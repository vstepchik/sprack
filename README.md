## Sprack

A tool for packing sprites/lightmaps/whatever textures into atlases, written in Rust.

Written while learning Rust. Inspired by [TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D)
and [@blackpawn's Packing Lightmaps](http://blackpawn.com/texts/lightmaps/default.html) text.
